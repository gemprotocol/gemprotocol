### 💎 GEM PROTOCOL - $GEM 💎

**GEM PROTOCOL** is a dApps platform that offers free applications for the Binance Smart Chain community. Our core mission is to generate values for the BSC community through dApps and utility projects.


📌 What's the difference between $GEM vs other thousands of projects?

99% of the projects promise to create dApps, wallet, NFTs etc but the vast majority never fulfill any of these promises. $GEM already has working dapps even before the token launch.


#### Our dApps:

**✅ Portfolio Tracker:**
Portfolio Tracker is very similar to CoinMarketCap's portfolio app but compatible with ANY coin / token from Binance Smart Chain. From Safemoon to any unknown gem in your wallet, we will be able to track price and their performance.

**✅ Rug Checker:**
Rug Checker is a smart contract scanner. Similar to Rug Screen but 100% free and without restrictions.

**Our token:**
The $GEM token will be our next release. Along with it we will launch new premium features (MultiWallet, Stop loss, Price notification) in our dApps that can be claimed by holding the $GEM token benefiting all holders.

**✅ If you want to participate in a project with real utility, dApps already launched and that will follow in the footsteps of other utility tokens like Poocoin and Bogged, join us!**
